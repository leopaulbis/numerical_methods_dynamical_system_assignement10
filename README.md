Assignement 10: Homoclinic symetric orbit RTBP 
<br><br> The file assignement 8 contains all the function that implement the RTBP, determine the crossing of a solution with a Poicaré section 
<br><br> The file main contain the code which for varying values of mu compute the first crossing with a Poincaré section (y=0)
<br><br> The execution of the main can take lot of time (around 7 hours), a better way to do that is to do it in C and used openmp or MPI in order to get more eficient computation
<br><br> The file plot_mu contain a code that plot x' in function of the values of mu
